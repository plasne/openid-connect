# Version 4.1.1

Version 4.1.1 fixes a bug with key rotation. When CasAuth was updated some version back to use PUBLIC_CERT_# instead of a template, there was actually no way to clear the cache on those certificates.

## Key Rotation

The [key rotation](../key-rotation.md) documentation has been updated to the current process.
